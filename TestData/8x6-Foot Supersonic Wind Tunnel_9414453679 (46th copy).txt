|  DESCRIPTION  |

After 1957, the 8 x 6 Supersonic Wind Tunnelâ€™s test section featured the perforated walls shown here with technicians preparing a ramjet inlet for testing.  The perforations allowed the tunnel to operate at transonic speeds.  Note the eccentrically mounted observation window in the sidewall.
